 * Capture a Payment
 *

 * Payments can be automatically captured by our platform. A payment can
 * also be captured by performing an API call. In order to capture an authorised 
 * (card) payment you have to send a modification request. This file
 * shows how an authorised payment should be captured by sending 
 * a modification request using SOAP. 
 * 
 * Please note: using our API requires a web service user. Set up your Webservice 
 * user: Adyen Test CA >> Settings >> Users >> ws@Company. >> Generate Password >> Submit
