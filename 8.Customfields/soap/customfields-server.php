/**
 * Customfields service using SOAP
 *
 * Custom fields are a powerful feature of the payment pages that allow you to 
 * add form fields to the HPP. These will be sent to you before final payment submission 
 * for approval; you may use this feature to capture any additional data or permissions \
 * that you may require, such as collecting shipping data, forcing the shopper to accept 
 * terms and conditions, or checking a validation code.
 *
 * Customfields are not enabled by default, they have to be enabled per skin.
 * How can I enable customfields?
 * 1. Enable for skin: CA >> Skins >> Select Skin >> Custom Fields >> Set up URLs
 * 2. Add HTML input fields in Skin they should have names like: name="customfields.subscribe:
 *    Please see the Skin Creation Manual on how to add customfields to your skin.
